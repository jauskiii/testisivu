### Introduction

JParticles(abbreviation for JavaScript particles) is a lightweight JavaScript library for build some cool particle effects in WEB page base on Canvas.


### Concept

The main Concept of API design are: `The Write Less, Do More` and `Keep It Simple And Stupid`. Hope the library is easy-to-use, high performance and easy-to-maintain.


### Compatibility

The library should work fine on the following browsers (because of [this compatibility table](./docs/compatibility_table.md)) :

- IE 9+
- Safari 6+
- Opera 15+
- Firefox 21+
- Chrome 23+

For not support browsers it will fail quietly.
